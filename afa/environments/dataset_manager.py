class EnvironmentDatasetManager:
    """An actor responsible for providing instances to acquisition environments.

    This class can be thought of as a queue, which lives in its own process, that
    provides data instances to active acquisition environments. Whenever an environment
    is reset (i.e. is ready to start a new episode), it asks an instance of this class
    for a new example from the dataset, which it will then use for the new episode.

    There are two main reasons for the existence of this class:
        1) We generally run many copies of the environment in parallel when training or
           even when evaluating. If the entire dataset were to be stored in each copy
           of the environment, then we would have many copies of a potentially very
           large dataset being (needlessly) created, therefore consuming large
           amounts of memory.
        2) This class provides more control over which instances are being sent to
           the environments and how many "epochs" have elapsed. With this class, we can
           run many environments in parallel, but still ensure that e.g. each instance
           in the test set is used exactly once.

    Args:
        features: A dataset in the form of a NumPy array. The first dimension should be
            the batch dimension. Note that only data features should be included here --
            if using a classification dataset with targets, the targets should be
            provided separately via the `targets` keyword argument.
        targets: Optional NumPy array containing classification targets, which should
            be aligned with `features`. If this is `None`, then calls to
            `get_new_instance` will only return a single item: the features. If
            targets are provided, then calls to `get_new_instance` will return both
            the features and corresponding target. It is assumed that the provided
            targets should range from 0 to n - 1, where n is the number of classes.
        error_on_new_epoch: If True, then an error will be raised if this manager
            tries to move to a second epoch (i.e. if `get_new_instance` is called
            enough times that repeat instances would need to be used). This can
            be useful for e.g. ensuring that instances are not getting evaluated
            multiple times at test time.
        seed: Optionally specified random seed to be used by this manager.
