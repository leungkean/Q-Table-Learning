class AcquisitionEnv(gym.Env, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """Abstract base class for acquisition environments.

    This class implements the functionality for an environment in which each episode
    consists of the agent sequential acquiring individual features of a single example
    in a dataset. At each timestep, the environment returns the features that have been
    observed so far in the episode and a binary mask indicating which features have
    been observed. A randomly selected instance in the dataset is chosen for each
    episode, and every example is seen one before repeating the dataset.

    Acquiring a feature is assumed to have an associated cost, and the reward produced
    by the environment after acquiring a given feature is the negative of the feature's
    acquisition cost. The costs can be uniform across all features, or they can vary.

    Choosing to reacquire a feature which has already been acquired will not change the
    environment state, but the acquisition cost of that feature will be incurred again.
    Generally, agents operating in this environment should implement a mechanism to
    prevent reacquiring features.

    While the action space is not specified for this abstract class, it is assumed that
    subclasses will have at least d + 1 actions, where d is the number of features.
    Actions 0, ..., d - 1 correspond to acquiring each of the d features, and actions
    larger than d - 1 are terminal.

    Args:
        dataset_manager: The dataset manager from which examples will be sourced.
        index_dims: This is the number of leftmost dimensions of a single example that
            should be interpreted as the feature index. The remaining dimensions are
            considered to be channels that belong to a single feature. For example, if
            working with images of the shape [64, 64, 3] and you want to acquire entire
            pixels at a time (rather than individually acquiring RGB values within a
            pixel), then `index_dims` should be set to 2. This also implies that the
            binary masks included in the environment observations will have shape
            [64, 64], not [64, 64, 3]. By default, all dimensions are assumed to be
            index dimensions.
        acquisition_cost: If this is a scalar, then every feature will have the same
            acquisition cost. This can also be an array with the same shape as the
            data's index dimensions, in which case each value corresponds to the cost
            of acquiring the feature at that location.
        max_acquisitions: The maximum number of acquisitions that are allowed in each
            episode. If the limit is reached, then the episode is forced to terminate.
            By default, there is no limit.
